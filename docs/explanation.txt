This is written in HTML and vanilla JavaScript. (I did import jQuery so I could use Bootstrap for the UI, but otherwise I kept my code plain JS.)

The grid size is inputted separately as X and Y, the rover instructions are inputted as one long string and parsed from there.

I made the arbitrary assumption that North is 0 degrees, and that turning 90 degrees to the right (i.e. clockwise) from North would make you face East.

Each rover is an instance of a class that is passed instructions from the main function. They can detect if the given starting position is out of bounds (off the grid), and if moving would also lead them out of bounds.
