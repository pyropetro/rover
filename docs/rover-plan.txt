Each rover has:
- A position
- A direction it's facing

Each rover can:
- Travel to specific coordinates
- Spin right or left by 90 degree increments
- Move forward one grid point in the direction it's facing:
	- N: (0, 1)
	- E: (1, 0)
	- S: (0, -1)
	- W: (-1, 0)


Commands are sent as a single long input. 
- Parse the input into separate lines
	- Should be at least 3 lines long

- Line 1: establishing grid boundaries for all rovers
	- Should be input in 2 positive integers

- Line 2: Rover 1's initial position and heading
	- Should be 2 positive integers within the grid boundaries (between 0 and the x and y boundaries), and 1 letter (N, E, S, W)
	- Rover needs to be able to take the letter and decode it into x and y movements

- Line 3: Rover 1's movement instructions
	- Should ONLY consist of L, R, and M (upper or lowercase)


	- Rover 1 then transmits new position and heading back to NASA
		- Should be in xyz format

- (Line 4: Rover 2's initial position and heading)
- (Line 5: Rover 2's movement instructions, transmits back)
...and so on until the end of the input
